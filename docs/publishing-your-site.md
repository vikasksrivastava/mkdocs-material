### VPN (Policy based)

#### Key Exchange Protocol

For two sides to encrypt or decrypt the traffic , a key needs to be shared between two endpoints.

You need the following to secure a Tunnel :

    - Key
    - Encryption
    - Hashing

> **Diffie Hellman** is the algorith that generates a `KEY` . Lifetime of a DH key is 3600 secs (1hr).

There are two tunnels :
1. `PHASE 1` The **first tunnel** is to exchange the KEY . `ISAKMP` Internet Security Association and Key Managment Protocol is used here .
2. `PHASE 2` The **second tunnel** is for Data transfer. `ESP` Encapsulation Security Payload is used in this phase.

<img src="/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180619143018242.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/>

> Though its not recommened , you can manually setup the `Phase 2` tunnel to use a manual key skipping the `Phase 1` negotiation (without using `ISAKMP`).


**Configuration example**

**1.  Configure the Parameters for `Phase 1`**
```sh
crypto isakmp policy 10
 auth pre-share   //KEY
 encryption 3des  //ENCRYTPION
 hash md5         //HASH
 group 2 // The group command actually generates the hey to be used in the second phase .

crytpto isakmp policy 20
 auth pre-share
 encrytption 3des
 hash sha
 group 2

crypto isakmp key cisco111 address 1.1.1.1
crypto isakmp key cisco111 address 2.2.2.2
```

**2.  Configure the Parameters for `Phase 2` (only encryption and hash , as we have already got the key from phase 1)**

```sh
crypto ipsec tranform-set TSET esp-3des esp-md5

```

**3.  Define traffic that will be encrypted over the Tunnel**

```sh
access-list 101 permit 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 10.2.2.0 0.0.0.255
```

**4. Finally Create a Crypto MAP to tie all of the above together**

```sh
crypto map CMAP 5 ipsec-isakmp ! (5 is sequence number , and isakmp means  (get the key from Diffie-Hellman))
match address 101  //access-list
set peer 192.168.1.10
set transform-set TSET // Configured above
```

**5. Apply on the interface**

int fa0/0
 crpypt map CMAP


Always ping with ping source field
show crypto ipsec sa
show crpto isakmp sa


THe tunnel will stay up for :

Phase 1  86400 sec 24 hrs
Phase 2 3600 sec 1 hr

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180619173443458.png)

> In the above VPN Configuration , the interesting traffic is define by an `ACL`. Such VPNs are called **Policy based VPN**.

### GRE Tunnel

GRE Tunnel basically creates a virtual point to point link between two routers which traditionally were establishing VPN based on interesting traffic define by ACLs . Which was a tedious process.

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180622062800407.png)

Here is the sample configuration of a GRE Tunnel. It is basically a two step process
1. Creat a virtual link between the two routers , in this example R1 and R2

2. Now since they are "virtually" directly connected , you can run a routing protocol to exchange routing information directly within them.

##### Step 1
R1

```sh
interface tun0
 ip add 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 tunnel source 192.1.10.2
 tunnel destination 192.1.20.2

```

R2

```sh
interface tun0
 ip add 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
 tunnel source 192.1.20.2
 tunnel destination 192.1.10.2
```


##### Step 2
Now you can run a routing protocol of choice to make them talk

```sh
!
router eigrp 10
 network 10.0.0.0
 network 192.168.1.0
 no auto-summary
!
```

---
### GRE over IPSec - Tunnel Mode

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180622070147560.png)

In this mode once the GRE tunnel is up , we basically apply the Crypto Map configuration as a `profile` to the tunnel interface (in this e.g IPROF )

> Notice that there is no need to define `match` for interesting traffic or `set-peer` as this is all taken care by the `tunnel0` interface by default as every traffic via the tunnel interface is interesting and the peer (set peer) is known because of GRE. .


```sh
! R1
! Configure Phase I

crypto isakmp policy 10
 auth pre-share
 encryption 3des
 hash md5
 group 2

crypto isakmp key cisco123 address 192.1.20.2


! Configure Phase II

crypto ipsec transform-set TSET esp-3des esp-md5

! Configure an IPSec Profile and attach the transform-set to it

crypto ipsec profile IPROF
 set transform-set TSET

! Assign the IPSec Profile to the Tunnel interface

interface tunnel0
  tunnel protection ipsec profile IPROF

```

```sh
! R2
! Configure Phase I

crypto isakmp policy 10
 auth pre-share
 encryption 3des
 hash md5
 group 2

crypto isakmp key cisco123 address 192.1.10.2


! Configure Phase II

crypto ipsec transform-set TSET esp-3des esp-md5

! Configure an IPSec Profile and attach the transform-set to it

crypto ipsec profile IPROF
 set transform-set TSET

! Assign the IPSec Profile to the Tunnel interface

interface tunnel0
  tunnel protection ipsec profile IPROF

```


Now notice that in the plain simple GRE the packet looked like this , which totaled  **88 bytes**:

```sh
+----+------------+------------+-------+-------------+------------+------+
|GRE | 192.1.10.1 | 192.1.20.3 | EIGRP | 192.168.1.1 | 224.0.0.10 | Data |
+----+------------+------------+-------+-------------+------------+------+
```

With IPSec enable on it (which we did in the config example above) the packet size increase to **140 bytes** because of the ESP header and now looks like this :

```sh
+----------------+-----------------+------------+------------+-------+-------------+------------+------+
|ESP| 192.1.10.X | 192.1.20.X| GRE | 192.1.10.1 | 192.1.20.3 | EIGRP | 192.168.1.1 | 224.0.0.10 | Data |
+----------------+-----------------+------------+------------+-------+-------------+------------+------+
```

> In the above packet , the entire packet including GRE is just a `data` packet (encapsulated in the ESP).

So the **overhead** is that you have increased the size of the packet by 52 bytes (140 - 88 = 52 ) .

`Tunnel Mode` is the default mode for IPSec .

Notice the `tunnel ` in output
```sh
show crypto ipsec sa

outbound esp sas:
 spi: 0x99D47D47(2580839751)
   transform: esp-3des esp-md5-hmac ,
   in use settings ={Tunnel, }
```


Now if you GRE and ESP header are the same , you can run IPSec in `Tranport Mode`

In transport mode , it will remove the duplication of ESP and GRE header and make the packet **smaller** .

---

### GRE / IPSec - Transport Mode

> An efficient mode over Tunnel Mode and saves some overhead on encryption





So with above theory

```sh
+----------------+-----------------+------------+------------+-------+-------------+------------+------+
|ESP| 192.1.10.X | 192.1.20.X| GRE | 192.1.10.1 | 192.1.20.3 | EIGRP | 192.168.1.1 | 224.0.0.10 | Data |
+----------------+-----------------+------------+------------+-------+-------------+------------+------+
```

Changes to

```sh
+----------------+-----------------+-------+-------------+------------+------+
|ESP| 192.1.10.X | 192.1.20.X| GRE | EIGRP | 192.168.1.1 | 224.0.0.10 | Data |
+----------------+-----------------+-------+-------------+------------+------+
```

Above changes saves **16** bytes for  you , so now your packet size becomes 140 - 16 = **124**

#### Configuration

The configuration of the transport mode is similar to the tunnel mode , the only change is highlighted below (`mode transport`)

```sh

crypto ipsec transform-set TSET esp-3des esp-md5
 mode transport

clear crypto sa
```

### Native IPSec Tunnel [S-VTI]

> Also know as Static Virtual TUnnel Interface

Now continuing on to the above flow , is GRE required for the IPSec ? Cant we run the IPSec over the tunnel interface without GRE ?  The answer to that is yes and we basically


```sh
interface tunnel0
 tunnel mode ipsec ipv4
```

So what benefit did the above change provide ?

The packet changed from
`ESP| 192.1.10.X | 192.1.20.X| GRE | EIGRP | 192.168.1.1 | 224.0.0.10 | Data |`

to  (remove of GRE header , 8 bytes)

`ESP| 192.1.10.X | 192.1.20.X| EIGRP | 192.168.1.1 | 224.0.0.10 | Data |`


Above changes saves **8** bytes for  you , so now your packet size becomes 124 - 8 = **116**

---
### MGRE (Multipoint GRE)

The point to point configuration setting above does not scale with a lot of sites , that is where MGRE comes to rescue.

Now since in GRE we had to define the tunnel destination address: `tunnel destination X.X.X.X`

Since in this case , their could be multiple destinations we need to use a mapping table which maps destination to be reached to the next hop address to be used . This system is called NHRP (Next Hop Resolution Protocol)


`ip nhrp map 192.168.1.1 192.1.10.1`

The above command means that if I want to go to `192.168.1.1` the public IP address for the same is `192.1.10.1`

```sh
interface tunnel0
 ip address 192.168.1.1
 tunnel source 192.168.20.2
 tunnel mode gre multipoint
 ip nhrp network-id 1
 ip nhrp map 192.168.1.1 192.1.10.1
 ip nhrp map 192.168.1.2 192.1.20.2
 ip nhrp map 192.168.1.3 192.1.30.3
```

  ip nhrp map 192.168.1.3 192.1.30.2

```

```sh
R1#show ip nhrp
192.168.1.2/32 via 192.168.1.2, Tunnel0 created 00:08:03, never expire
  Type: static, Flags: used
  NBMA address: 192.1.20.2
192.168.1.3/32 via 192.168.1.3, Tunnel0 created 00:08:03, never expire
  Type: static, Flags: used
  NBMA address: 192.1.30.2

  Type: static, Flags: used

R1#
```


**DISADVANTAGES** In this type of NHRP Based name resolution you need to **statically** define the mapping which is not scalable and **also requires all sites to have static IP Addressing.**

Now this disadvantage was eliminiated by the use of a **Next Hop Server** like a DNS naming server.

**How does the `Next Hop Server` works ?**

Under the inteface configuration on the end routers , we define the Next Hop Servers IP Address. When these interfaces come up they register their information to the Next Hop Server notifying :

"Hey my Tunnel address is `X.X.X.X` and my Public address is `Y.Y.Y.Y` "


**Now the NHS Server has all the mapping of Tunnel IP and the Public IP .**

---

### DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint VPN)

**How does the `Next Hop Server` works ?**

Under the inteface configuration on the end routers , we define the Next Hop Servers IP Address. When these interfaces come up they register their information to the Next Hop Server.

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180622171449545.png)

**Step 1.** Enabling the Next Hop Server

```sh
! R1

interface tunnel0
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 tunnel source f0/0
 tunnel mode gre multipoint
 ip nhrp network-id 1
 ip nhrp map multicast dynamic // For sending the reply for EIGRP packets received from clients , the NHS Server knows who to send the reply by looking at the dynamic NHRP table.

router eigrp 100
 no auto
 network 10.0.0.0
 network 192.168.1.0
 network 172.16.0.0

```

That's all for configuring a NHS!

**Step 2.** Configuring the Next Hop Client

```sh
! R2

interface tunnel0
 ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
 tunnel source f0/1
 tunnel mode gre multipoint
 ip nhrp network-id 1
 ip nhrp nhs 192.168.1.1
 ip nhrp map 192.168.1.1  192.1.10.2 // How do I reach the NHS ? This line basically points every client to the Next Hop Server.
 ip nhrp map multicast 192.1.10.2 // For the EIGRP Packets

 router eigrp 100
  no auto
  network 10.0.0.0
  network 192.168.1.0
  network 172.16.0.0
```

Repeat the above configuration for other Clients on the DMVPN.

```sh
R1#sh ip nhrp
192.168.1.2/32 via 192.168.1.2, Tunnel0 created 00:00:12, expire 01:59:47
  Type: dynamic, Flags: unique registered used
  NBMA address: 192.1.20.2
```

**This completes your DMVP Configuration.**



### DMVPN - EIGRP - Phases [I,II,III]

**Phase I** - With the default configuration of DMVPN only the neighborship is formed between `Hub` and `Spoke` routers but not between `Spoke` and `Spoke` directly.

To resolve this we to turn off split-horizon on the hub.

> **Split Horizon**, dont send the update back on the same interface you learned the route on.


```sh
interface tunnel0
 no ip split-horizon eigrp 100
```

**BEFORE** (without the split-horizon configured)

```sh
R2#sh ip route eigrp
     172.16.0.0/24 is subnetted, 2 subnets
D       172.16.1.0 [90/297372416] via 192.168.1.1, 00:10:13, Tunnel0
     10.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 2 subnets
D       10.1.1.0 [90/297372416] via 192.168.1.1, 00:10:13, Tunnel0
```

**AFTER** (after the split-horizon configured)

```sh
R2#sh ip route eigrp
     172.16.0.0/24 is subnetted, 4 subnets
D       172.16.4.0 [90/310172416] via 192.168.1.1, 00:00:08, Tunnel0
D       172.16.1.0 [90/297372416] via 192.168.1.1, 00:18:44, Tunnel0
D       172.16.3.0 [90/310172416] via 192.168.1.1, 00:00:08, Tunnel0
     10.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 4 subnets
D       10.4.4.0 [90/310172416] via 192.168.1.1, 00:00:08, Tunnel0
D       10.3.3.0 [90/310172416] via 192.168.1.1, 00:00:08, Tunnel0
D       10.1.1.0 [90/297372416] via 192.168.1.1, 00:18:44, Tunnel0
```
---
**Phase II** (Traffic from Spoke to Spoke goes direct) - Second you would like the traffic to be point to point and not hoping thorough the NHS Router (look at the putput above where all traffic is hopping through 192.168.1.1).

Notice the traffic is going via 192.168.1.1

```sh
R3#traceroute 10.2.2.1

Type escape sequence to abort.
Tracing the route to 10.2.2.1

  1 192.168.1.1 20 msec 20 msec 20 msec
  2 192.168.1.2 32 msec *  48 msec
R3#
```

The resolution of this issue is to ensure that the `next-hop` isnt changed. In the above example

1. `R2` told `R1` about its routes first.
2. Then R1 tells `R3` about its routes , here it changes the `next-hop` for addresss learned from `R2` to itself .


```sh
interface tunnel0
 no ip next-hop-self eigrp 100
```

**BEFORE**  (All traffic going via 192.168.1.1)

```sh
R2#sh ip route eigrp
     172.16.0.0/24 is subnetted, 4 subnets
D       172.16.4.0 [90/310172416] via 192.168.1.1, 00:00:08, Tunnel0

D       172.16.3.0 [90/310172416] via 192.168.1.1, 00:00:08, Tunnel0
     10.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 4 subnets
D       10.4.4.0 [90/310172416] via 192.168.1.1, 00:00:08, Tunnel0

```

**AFTER**  ( Now , all site specific traffic goes to the specific sites router **without** hopping over 192.168.1.1)

```sh
R2#sh ip route eigrp

**Phase III** -

In this phase NHRP basically redirects Spokes to reach directly out to other spokes its tryign to reach.

The NHS Server points the spokes to where they are trying to reach and installs a NHRP Cache entry pointing towards that remote spoke in the requesting spoke.

```sh
! HUB
ip nhrp redirect
```

```sh
! SPOKES
ip nhrp shortcut
```

So with this , only the first NHRP resolution request is sent to `R1` and the remaining data flow happens directly

```sh
R4#trace 10.3.3.1

Type escape sequence to abort.
Tracing the route to 10.3.3.1

  1 192.168.1.1 28 msec 40 msec
    192.168.1.3 24 msec
R4#trace 10.3.3.1

Type escape sequence to abort.
Tracing the route to 10.3.3.1

  1 192.168.1.3 32 msec *  40 msec
```


### Redundancy [Dual-Hub DMVPN Setup]

In this case you basically copy the configuration of the existing NHS  , make a new NHS . Point each other NHS with a MAP command and run routing protocol on both .

After this you point your spokes to the additional NHS . Pretty basic stuff .


**Encrypting the Tunnel using IPSEC**

```sh
!1. Phase 1

crypto isakmp policy 10
 auth pre-share
 hash md5
 encryption 3des
 crypto isakmp key cisco123 address 0.0.0.0

 !2. Phase 2

 crypto ipsec transform-set TSET esp-3des esp-md5
  mode transport
  exit

!3. IPSec Profile

 crypto ipsec profile PROF
  set transform-set TSET
  exit

!4. Apply the profile to the interface

 interface tunnel 0
  tunnel protection ipsec profile PROF

```

### GETVPN

> GetVPN is a Cisco only solution

GETVPNS are used in a MPLS Private WAN type deployments as the GETVPNs packets cannot be routed over the internet.

Why do we need GETVPNs when we have DMVPN : THe purpose to ket full encryption capabilities while the routing is already setup.

GetVPN copies the inner header onto the outer header.
It only works on fully routed networks. It can potentially work on the Internet but only if you are using Public addresses on the inside .

A multisite IPSec VPN uses a single session key for multiple sites . It has two entities ; `Key Server` and `Group Member`

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180623141229194.png)

> Session key is exchanged in `Phase 1` and used in `Phase 2`

In a normal Phase 1 (ISA) , the only thing exchanges happens is the session key.

**`ISAKMP`** This protocol only echanges `Session Key` . Run on UDP/500
**`GDOI` (Group Domain of Interpretation)** : This Exchanges `Session Key` , `Interesting Traffic ACL`, `Transform Set` and is specially made for GETVPNs. Runs on UDP/848 . This protocol is like an extension for ISAKMP.

**In GETVPNs ,**

**`PHASE 1`** is setup between `Group Member` and `Key Server` .
**`PHASE 2`** is setup between `Group Member` and `Group Member`


> **Prerquisite for GETVPN** : Make sure all networks are able to reach all networks

#### Configuration of a GETVPN

**Step 1.** Configure the Key Server

```sh
! KEY SERVER

! 1. Phase I

crypto isakmp policy 10
 auth pre-share
 hash md5
 enc 3des
 group 2

crypto isakmp key cisco123 address 192.1.10.2
crypto isakmp key cisco123 address 192.1.20.2
crypto isakmp key cisco123 address 192.1.30.2

! 2. Phase II

crypto ipsec transform-set TSET esp-3des esp-sha-hmac

! 3. Configure IPSEC Profile

crypto ipsec profile IPROF
 set transform-set TSET

! 4. Configure Interesting traffic ACL

access-list 101 permit ip 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255

! 5. Configure the GDOI Group Configuration

crypto gdoi group SALES
 identity number 111 ! Should match on the Group members
 server local ! I am the key server , so local
  sa ipsec 10
   profile IPROF
   match address ipv4 101
address ipv4 192.1.40.2
```

**Step 1.** Configure the Group Members

```sh
!R1

! 1. Phase I

crypto isakmp policy 10
 auth pre-share
 hash md5
 enc 3des
 group 2

crypto isakmp key cisco123 address 192.1.40.2

! 2. Configure GDOI to point to the Key Server

crypto gdoi group GRP-R1
 identity number 111 ! Should match on the Group members
 server address ipv4 192.1.40.2 ! Point to the key server

! 3. Configure a Crypto MAP

crypto map CMAP 10 gdoi
 set group GRP-R1

! 4. Apply Crypto MAP to the outgoing interface
int f0/0
 crypto map CMAP ! As soon as you do this , the key is downloaded.
```

Once you enter the above configuration on the Group member you will see the following output on the member :

```sh
*Mar  1 01:12:10.919: %CRYPTO-5-GM_REGSTER: Start registration to KS 192.1.40.2 for group GRP-R1 using address 192.1.10.2
*Mar  1 01:12:10.947: %CRYPTO-6-GDOI_ON_OFF: GDOI is ON
*Mar  1 01:12:11.711: %GDOI-5-GM_REGS_COMPL: Registration to KS 192.1.40.2 complete for group GRP-R1 using address 192.1.10.2
```

**Verification Commands**

```sh
R4-KEYSERVER#show crypto gdoi ks members

Group Member Information :

Number of rekeys sent for group SALES : 0

Group Member ID   : 192.1.10.2
Group ID          : 111
Group Name        : SALES
Key Server ID     : 192.1.40.2

Group Member ID   : 192.1.20.2
Group ID          : 111
Group Name        : SALES
Key Server ID     : 192.1.40.2

Group Member ID   : 192.1.30.2
Group ID          : 111
Group Name        : SALES
Key Server ID     : 192.1.40.2

R4-KEYSERVER#show crypto gdoi
GROUP INFORMATION

    Group Name               : SALES (Multicast)
    Group Identity           : 111
    Group Members            : 0
    IPSec SA Direction       : Both
    Active Group Server      : Local
    Group Rekey Lifetime     : 86400 secs
    Rekey Retransmit Period  : 10 secs
    Rekey Retransmit Attempts: 2

      IPSec SA Number        : 10
      IPSec SA Rekey Lifetime: 3600 secs
      Profile Name           : IPROF
      Replay method          : Count Based
      Replay Window Size     : 64
      ACL Configured         : access-list 101

    Group Server list        : Local

```

**Re-keyeing :**

The lifetime of a key is 3600s , the lifetime counter starts when the first group member registers and a key is handed over.

Let's say when a Group Member G1 registers to Key Server KS , the Key K1 is handed over with a count down timer started.

*After 5 minutes (300sec) another Group Member G2 registers , it will be handed over the same key as G1 but the time remaining on it will be 3600-300=3300 secs.*

**OR**

*You can configure RE-KEYING , which basically sends a new key to everyone when a new Group Members join . This can be done over UNICAST or MULTICAST.*


**Re-Keyeing Configuration** (Only done on Key Server)

**Step 1.** Generate a RSA Keypair on the Key Server

```sh
crypto key generate rsa modulus 1024 label GETVPN-KEY
```

**Step 2.** Configre the GDOI group for re-keyeing

```sh
crypto gdoi group SALES
 server local
 rekey transport unicast
 rekey authentication mypubkey rsa GETVPN-KEY
 rekey algorithm 3des-cbc
 rekey lifetime seconds 3600
```

### VRF - Aware VPNs

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180630135437874.png)

Now in the VRF example above the traffic between the loopback networks 10.1.1.3 to 10.2.2.4 is no encrypted. In this section we will enxrypt the data.

**Objective** R1 and R2 should encrypt traffic between 10.1.1.3 to 10.2.2.4.

> Only R1 Config is displayed for brevity. Replicate the config for R2 changing the IP Addresses.

```sh
! R1
! 1. Phase I
! A. ISAKMP Policies
crypto isakmp policy 10
 auth pre-share
 hash md5
 enc 3des
 group 2

#### MAJOR DIFFERENCE IS IN THIS SECTION - BEGIN

! B. Create the Keyring
crypto keyring KR-1 vrf CUST-A
 pre-shared-key address 10.12.12.1 key cisco123

! C. Create an ISAKMP Profile which later on will be linked to crytpto map
crypto isakmp profile PROF-A
 vrf CUST-A
 keyring KR-1
 match identity address 10.12.12.1 255.255.255.255 CUST-A

#### MAJOR DIFFERENCE IS IN THIS SECTION - END

! 2. Phase II
crypto ipsec transform-set TSET esp-3des esp-md5

 match address 101
 set peer 10.12.12.1
 set transform-set TSET
crypto map CUST-A isakmp-profile PROF-A

! 5. Apply the Crypto map to the interface
interface fa1/0
 crypto map CUST-A
```

**Always ensure a `source` ping**

```sh
R3#ping 10.2.2.4 source 10.1.1.3

Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.2.2.4, timeout is 2 seconds:

### VRF Aware [Get VPN]

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180701153254761.png)

**PREFACE** :  In the above configuration the once the IP Addressing is setup , there is EIGRP neighborship configured withing a VRF in the colored areas and the interfaces (no VRF on the R1 or R3 , only on R2).
With this , R1 and R3 cannot reach the Key Server . To enable that we have to configure the following (route-leaking) so that the networks behind R1 and R3 can reach the Key Server . The eventual goal is to encrypt traffic between `R1 and R2` and `R1 and R3` .

The config below is to make R3 reach R5 (Key Server)

**Step 1.** R3 ---> R2

`ip route 10.45.45.5 255.255.255.255 10.20.20.2`

**Step 2.** R2 ----> R4 From VRF to Global Table and pointing to R4 (Next Hop)

`ip route vrf CUST-B 10.45.45.45.5 255.255.255.255 fa1/0 10.24.24.4`

**Step 3.** Back from R4 to R2

`ip route 10.20.20.0 255.255.255.0  10.24.24.2`

**Step 4.**  From Global Routing table to VRF Routing Table for CUST-B

`ip route 10.20.20.0 255.255.255.0 fa0/1`


Now lets configure the VPN .

#  Routers as a CA Server

In this section we will take a few steps to make the `PHASE I` a bit more secure. When we talk about certificates we are talking about `PHASE I`.

Again , a Key , Encryption and Hash is required in the Phase I. In the examples till now it has been the Pre-shared keys. Also know as PSK (Pre shared key)

This althoug isnt bad , althoug we are are setting this same key across two devices. The same key can be bruteforced if a lot of data is collected.

**So to make the above more secure , we will  replace the Preshared Key with the PKI Key**

What is  PKI : PKI works on the premise of a key-pair , using a mechanism called Key-Pair (Public and Private).

Public Key : Used to Encrypt the Data
Private Key : Used to Decrypt the Data .

So between the routers participating in a VPN connection (for example R1 and R2).

```sh
R1 ------- Please send me your PUB Key ----- > R2
R1 <------ Please send me your PUB Key ------ R2
```

R1 and R2 get each other Public Key , they keep their private keys with themselves.

> Anything encrypted by my `public key` can only be decrypted by the corresponding `private key` .

**The problem here , is we do not know if the device requesting the Public Key is the realy device and not a masquerade attempt. This is where the CA comes in.**


The function of a CA Server is to validate an identity. Its an authority that both R1 and R2 trust.

1. You send you Public Key and your company documents to Verisign.
2. Versign verifies and signs that for you and provides you the **`X509`** certificate.
3. The other company who wants to talk to you , does the same.

So now both companies have their own certificates (**`ID-CERT`**).


![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180701202633932.png)

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180701202738132.png)


CA Server Based Setup

1. Configure your CA Server
2. Generate the Public/Private Key on the local device.
3. Download the Root Certificate from the CA Server.
4. Send/Enroll your public key with the CA Server
5. CA Server validates your credentials and issues you an ID Cert.

The Entities Publick Key
Info about the entitity
CA Information
Digital Signature of the CA Server

6. The identity certificate is send back to the entity .


Certificate Relocation List : Checks for Certificates currency (How current it is)


![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180701212428524.png)

**Step 1. CA Server Configuration**

1. Sync the Clock

```sh
clock timezone EST 4
clock set XX:XX:XX 29 Aug 2019
```

2. Generate the RSA Key pair for the CA Server , this will be used for the root cert.

`crypto key generate rsa modulus 1024 label IOSCA `

3. Configure your Router as a Web SERVER

`ip http server`

4. Configure the CA  Server Parameters

```sh
crypto pki server IOSCA
 database url flash:
 issuer-name CN=ABC CA Server O=ABC OU=Training L=Dubai C=IN
 grant auto
 no shut
```

**Step 2. Client Configuration**

1. Sync the Clock

```sh
clock timezone EST 4
clock set XX:XX:XX 29 Aug 2019
```

2. Generate the RSA Key pair for the CA Server , this will be used for the root cert.

`crypto key generate rsa modulus 1024`

3. Configure your Router as a Web SERVER

`ip domain-name devopsimplified.com`
`ip http server`

4. Create a pointer to the CA Server

crypto ca trustpoint TRUSPOINT
 enrollment url http://10.2.2.2:80
 revocation-check none


5. Download the root certificate from the CA Server

crypto ca authenticate TRUSTPOINT

6. Enroll your public key with the CA Server and get a certificate issued. [ID Cert]

(On Client)# crypto ca enroll TRUSTPOINT

(client)# show crypto pki certificate

**This concludes the PKI infrastructure configration on both the Server and the Client. In the next step we will confgure the VPN between the clients**

## CA Based VPNs

**Step 3. IPSec LAN to LAN VPN using Certificates**

```sh
! 1. Phase I
crypto isakmp policy 10
 auth rsa-sig ! This is changed for the crypto based on signatures
 hash md5
 enc 3des
 group 2

!2. Phase II

crypto ipsec transform-set TSET esp-3des esp-sha-hmac

!3. Interesting Traffic

acces-list 101 permit 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 10.3.3.0 0.0.0.255

!4. Crypto Map

crypto map CMAP 10 ipsec-isakmp
 match address 101
 set-peer 192.168.13.3
 set transform-set TSET

! 5. Apply to interface

int fa0/0
 crypto map CMAP
```

# IKEv2 VPNS

What does IKEv2 bring to the table . IKEv2 is the replacemnt for ISAKMP which was also know as IKEv1 . IKEv2 pertains to the PHASE I only.

What does IKEv2 Bring to the table :

**Scalability** :  Lets say in a Hub and Spoke type of VPN setup , multiple clients will could have different type of Phase I policy.  On the Hub you would have to create multiple configuration to support all the Spokes.

> IKEv2 allows scalability by usnign proposals which automatically expands to different combinations of Encryption , Integrity and Hash .

IKEv2 Proposal (Could use a combination of all the options below)

 - Encrypt  `3DES` , `AES`
 - Integrity `MDS5` , `SHA`
 - Group `2`,`5`

**Directional Pre-shared Keys** : Allows the use of different preshared keys for the Phase I organisation. (Earlier the Pre-shared keys used to be same , in this case in each direction the key could be different)


**More Secure Algorithms** : More `SHA` variants availaible in IKEv2


## IKEv2 VPN using legacy methods

```

# Flex VPN
## Site to Site VPN [D-VTI / S-VTI based ]

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180703080419330.png)

**FOUNDATION**

In this example we are establisihisng a VPN tunnel between R1 and R2.
In a normal S-VTI (Static Virtual Tunnel Interface) you know the `tunnel destination`  address. In this example the twist is that , what if the IP Address on R2's e0/0 is dynamic ?

Here's is what a typical tunnel interface configuration looks like :

```sh
! R2
interface tunnel 12
 ip add 192.168.12.1 255.255.255.0
 tunnel source e0/0
 tunnel destination 192.1.10.1  ! ### NOTICE
 tunnel mode ipsec ipv4
 tunnel protection ipsec profile IPROF-12
```

Notice the destination configuration (on R2) pointing to R1's known and static address of e0/0. But what is R2's e0/0 is dynamic ?

**R1 would not be able to point the same way to R2 and R2 did.**

To resolve this situation , we use (on R1)  `interface Virtual-template` which has all the configuration as above interface but **does not** have the `tunnel destination` command.

Once `R2` is assigned an IP Address on `e0/0` by its ISP and tries to reach out to `R1` , `R1` gets to know the public IP Address of `R2` and creates a `Virtual Interface` with the now known address as the destination address.

# ASA Firewalls

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180703154612386.png)

ASA is technicaly a router acting as a firewall. `Outside` is your external network , `Inside` is your internal network and `DMZ` is things like your email , web and DNS Server.

ASA though is a router , it has some different charecteristc. Traffic from one interface one iterface to other is allowed by default on a router. On an ASA though it does not allow all traffic to traverese through it.

- Traffic flow through the firewalls is controlled by the **Security Levels** fof the interface. By default the security level of the interface is set to 0.

- `Name of the interface` is a required parameter along with the `Security level`.
- If you name the interface `inside` , the security level is set to `100`.
Traffic moving from **Higher** security level to **Lower** is allowed by default. **Low** to **High** is blocked. (Default charecteristc) . Any other name on a blank interface set the security level to 0.

- Traffic between same security level , the communication **would not** happen **AT ALL** (even after creatign exceptions). Now this behaviour can be changed by  `same-security-traffic permit inter-interface`  which allows all communication between the same security levels .

- For traffic goign from high to low , the traffic will go through. NOTE: By default only TCP/IP is inspected , which means outgoign traffic will be allowed to go out and come in. Everythign else (Apart from TCP/IP) is not inspected by default , hence can go out but not come in.

- ASA only blocks THRU traffic , traffic coming TO firewall is allowed.
The only reason you are allowed to PING is becuase the ICMP feature is enabled by default.
- Firewall does not allow Telnet on a Level 0 interface. It has to be specificcaly allowed based on source.
- If a connection is allowed `in` to an ASA, then it will automatically be allowed `out`, as ASAs are stateful. This means you do not need to write an `in` and an `out` ACL, just an `in`.

## Interface Configuration


To default an interface .
```sh
clear configure interface gi0
```

Shows the active connections
```sh
ciscoasa# show conn
1 in use, 1 most used
TCP Outside  192.1.20.2:23 inside  10.11.11.1:56358, idle 0:00:09, bytes 184, flags UIO
```

Typical Access List
```sh
access-list ABC permit tcp host 192.1.20.2 10.11.11.0 255.255.255.0 eq telnet
access-group ABC in interface outside ! IN denotes the direction , outside is the interface on which it is applied.
```

To disable **TO** traffic to the interface of the firewall :

```sh
icmp deny any outside
```

To allow Internal to ping out :

```sh
icmp permit any echo-reply outside
```

Allow on single endpoint [192.1.20.2] to ping from Outside :

```sh
icmp permit host 192.1.20.2 echo outside
```

To enable ssh

```sh
crypto key generate rsa modulus 1024
username admin pass cisco123
aaa authentication ssh console LOCAL !Local Authentication
```

## Routing Configuration

**Checking routes on a ASA**

```sh
ciscoasa# show route

Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP
       D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area
       N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2
       E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2, E - EGP
       i - IS-IS, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2, ia - IS-IS inter area
       * - candidate default, U - per-user static route, o - ODR
       P - periodic downloaded static route

Gateway of last resort is not set

C    192.1.20.0 255.255.255.0 is directly connected, Outside
D    10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 [90/156160] via 10.11.11.1, 0:00:12, inside
C    10.11.11.0 255.255.255.0 is directly connected, inside
C    192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 is directly connected, DMZ
```

**Source NAT**  If my `internal` address is gettign translated, regardless if the direction of the access, it is called `Source NAT`. Basicall if `MY` address is getting translated its `Source NAT`.

**Destiation NAT** If the  External Address / Remote Address / Foreign Addresss changes , it is called `Destination NAT` . The word destination is **"THEM"** .

> **99% of the time you are doing Source NAT .**





**Source Dynamic NAT** Allows internal users to go out using Public address from a pool defined on the firewall. Also know as Object NAT or Auto NAT  (In the picture above , its traffic goign from R1 to R2 being natted at ASA)

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180704210146346.png)

> It is called Dynamic becuase its on need basis when traffic arrives at the ASA

```sh
########## Source Dynamic NAT Configuration Example #############

! 1. Define the pool

object network POOL1 ! Pool of externally reachable IP Addresses.
 range 192.1.20.101 192.1.20.200

! 2. Specify the address that can use the pool

object network INS-NET
 subnet 10.11.11.0 255.255.255.0
 nat (inside,outside) dynamic POOL1
 ! This is where I link the POOL , saying traffic going from
 ! inside to outside should be dynamically natted using the pool POOL1
```

To check the trhasnaltions of NAT table .


```sh
show xlate
```

**Source Static NAT**

> Translates an internal address on the outside. This is done staticaly so that an entry is created on trnaslation table.

> You still need to allow the accesss from Low to High. **Access list needs to be created**.

In contrast to the above Dynamic Source Nat configuration , what about the traffic coming from the internet to the the DMZ . Email , Web Servers need a static IP to be bound to so that people can reach them.

This is where we would need **Static NAT**

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180704210457844.png)
Example of Nat'ing the **Web Server** in DMZ

```sh
! Creation of NAT Entry
object network WWW1
 host 192.168.1.11 ! Address of Web Server in DMZ
 nat (dmz, outside) static 192.1.20.21
 ! Means , translation of DMZ address to Ourside address of 192.1.20.21
```

```sh
! Creation of Access list
access-list OUTSIDE permit tcp any host 192.168.1.11 eq 80
access-list OUTSIDE permit tcp any host 192.168.1.11 eq 80
!
access-group OUTSIDE in interface outside
```

> ![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180705130808410.png)
**Note**:

> **1. Most of the time 99%, the flow looks like above , the traffic from the inside (`RED`) is connfigured first and then the the outside direction (`BLUE`).**
> **2. Also most of the time 99% , the first interface is higher security level (`RED`) and next is the lower security level (`BLUE`).**

> ![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180705150643228.png)
> **`RED` works on Source Address , `BLUE` works on Destination Address**
> **So lets say in the traffic example above , where traffic is coming from the outside to the DMZ :**

> **Step 1.** Packet comes fromt he internet `199.1.1.1` to `192.1.20.21` and arrives on the `OUTSIDE` interface.
**Step 2.** Since `OUTSIDE` looks at/ works on at the *destination address of the packet* (look at the mapping in the picture) and matches the configured address `192.1.20.21` it changes the destination address from `192.1.20.21` to `192.168.1.11`. Now the packet looks like `Src 199.1.1.1 --> Dst 192.168.1.11`
**Step 3.** Next the Web Server at `192.168.1.11` responds back with source as `192.168.1.11` and destination as `199.1.1.1`, this arrives on the DMZ interface.
> Since `DMZ` in this case looks at the Source Address , it changes the source address from 192.168.1.11 to  192.1.20.21 and send the packet back on the internet. `Src 192.1.20.21 --> Dst 199.1.1.1`

## Dynamic PAT

Now since all the above examples of NAT a one to one mappng between extenral and internal address is done. It wastes a lot of public addresses and is not efficient. Hence PAT is considered here.

**Two Options**

1. Using the Outside Interface

```sh
object network INS-NET
 subnet 10.11.11.0 255.255.255.0
 nat (inside,outside) dynamic interface
```

2. Using an IP Address

```sh
A. Create an IP Address or Pool of IPs

object network POOL-A
 host 192.1.20.5

B. Create the Inside Network and specify to use the Pool for the PAT

object network INS-NET
 subnet 10.11.11.0 255.255.255.0
 nat (ins,out) dynamic pat-pool POOL-A
```

## Static PAT - For Public Facing Servers

```sh
object network WWW1
 host 192.168.1.11
 nat (dmz,outside) static 192.1.20.11 service tcp 80 80
!
object network EMAIL1
 host 192.168.1.12
 nat (dmz,outside) static 192.1.20.11 service tcp 25 25
!
object network DNS1
 host 192.168.1.12
 nat (dmz,outside) static 192.1.20.11 service tcp 53 53
!
!
object network R3
 host 192.168.1.3
 nat (dmz,outside) static 192.1.20.11 service tcp 23 2311
 ! Traffic coming on 192.1.20.11 on port 2311
 ! should get translated to 192.168.1.3 port 23
```

**Example**
> ![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180705134607176.png)
**Traffic coming on 192.1.20.11 on port 2311 (from `outside`) should get translated to 192.168.1.3 port 23 (in the `dmz`)**

## Twice NAT

This allows you to change the Source as well as the detination in a single NAT statement. This is also known as the Manual-NAT.

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180705182234157.png)

1. Create Object for all the addresses involved.

```sh
object network R3-D ! Address of Mainfram in the DMZ
 host 192.168.1.3
object network R3-O ! Address on Mainframe on Outside
 host 192.1.20.20
!
object network H199-O ! Address of the internet host.
 host 199.1.1.1
object network H199-D
 host 192.168.1.79
```

2. Create the Twice-Nat/Manual-NAT statement.

```sh

nat source static R3-D R3-O destination static destination static H199-D H199-O
!
! nat (dmz,outside) source static R3-D R3-O destination static destination static H199-D H199-O
! You could do it like above (dmz,inside) to lock down to the interface level.

```
>**The above line means that If the packet is going from R3-D to H199-D , change R3-D to R3-O and change H199-D H199-O**

---

# Transparent Firewall

Notice the same IP Subnet `192.1.10.0` is divided in two VLANs (10, 20)

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180705204955741.png)

**CONFIGURATION**

1. Configuring the firewall as transparent

`firewall transparent`

2. Configure the interface to be part of the same Bridge-group

```sh
interface e0
 nameif inside
 security-level 100
 bridge-group 5
 no shut

interface e1
 nameif outside
 security-level 0
 bridge-group 5
 no shut
```

3. Enable the IP Address on bridge group to forward traffic

```sh
interface bvi 5
 ip address 192.1.10.10
```

Once the above is done , everthing else is managed as the standard firewall.

```sh
acces-list OUTSIDE permit tcp host 192.1.10.3 host 192.1.10.1 eq telnet
access-group OUTSIDE in interface inside/outside
```

**Ethertype ACLs**
```sh
access-list ABC ethertype permit 0x2133
access-group ABC permit in
```

## Failover

Failover is redundancy at the device level .

### Active / Standby (Stateless)

Active - The box which is in the forwarding mode. All configurations are done on the Active Box .

Standby - The box that is not forwarding but has all the configurations limited .

> **The active box will respond to the ARP request from the clients**

Primary - Secondary is defined in configuration. When the ASA pair boots for the firt time the ASA defines as Primary becomes Active and the one defined as Secondary becomes Standby.

> The definition of Primary/Seconday does not change in case of falilue. These are Roles. During failover the device moves from Active to Standby and vice versa.

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180708134758390.png)

```sh
! ACTIVE  ASA6
failover lan interface FAILOVER eth2
failover interface ip FAILOVER 10.100.100.1 255.255.255.0 standby 10.100.100.2
! The first IP is for ACTIVE and the second for STANDBY.
failover lan unit primary
failover key cisco123 ! For securing communication
failover
!
! STANDBY ASA7
failover lan interface FAILOVER eth2
failover interface ip FAILOVER 10.100.100.1 255.255.255.0 standby 10.100.100.2
failover lan unit secondary
failover key cisco123
failover
!
```

The one configured above is a Stateless failover , where the end user isnt replicated for both the firewalls

```sh

ASA7(config)# ..

	Detected an Active mate
Beginning configuration replication from mate.
ERROR: Password recovery was not changed, unable to access
the configuration register.
Crashinfo is NOT enabled on Full Distribution Environment
End configuration replication from mate.

```

> **To display the current state of ASA in CLI use `prompt hostname state`**



***The one configured above is a `Stateless failover` , where the end user isnt replicated for both the firewalls , with that we move into the next topic of `Active/Standby` with `Statefull` firewalls***


### Active / Standby (Statefull)

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180708140539316.png)

To configure active active failover for ASA , you have to configure another failover link :

```sh

! Using separate link for Active/Active config
interface eth3
failover link Stateful_Failover eth3
failover interface ip Stateful_Failover 10.200.200.1 255.255.255.0 standby 10.200.200.2
!
```

OR use the same link used for active/standby config .

```sh
ASA6(config)# failover link FAILOVER eth2
```

### Active / Active (Statefull)

In active/active failover , one of each context is `ACTIVE` in different ASA and the other is `PASSIVE`.

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180710064903498.png)

> In case of a box failure , the Active Context on the failed box will move to the other active ASA.

```sh
! ASA1
failover lan interface FAILOVER eth2
failover interface ip FAILOVER 10.100.100.1 255.255.255.0 standby 10.100.100.2
failover lan unit primary
failover key cisco123
!

!
context SALES
 join-failover-group 1 ! Making Sales active on Primary
!
context FINANCE
 join-failover-group 2 ! Making Finance active on Secondary
!
failover link FAILOVER eth2 ! for active state replication .
!
failover
```

```sh
! ASA2
failover lan interface FAILOVER eth2
failover interface ip FAILOVER 10.100.100.1 255.255.255.0 standby 10.100.100.2
failover lan unit secondary
failover key cisco123
!
failover
```

```sh
wr mem all ! Saves all config
```


## ASA VPN Configuration (NAT-T)

> An example of a VPN tunnel traversin the Firewall

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180712023617644.png)

In the above picture `R3` and `R2` are establishing VPN tunnel in the standard way pointing to each other peer ip address **which is directly reachable on the internet without the need of NAT** .

`UDP 500 (ISAKMP) and ESP Traffic` needs to be permiited through the firewall . like following :

```sh
access-list OUTSIDE permit udp host x.x.x.x host x.x.x.x eq 500
access-list OUTSIDE permit esp host x.x.x.x host x.x.x.x

access-group OUTSIDE in interface outside
```

**Now above configuration is OK , but what if you have to establish VPN between `R1` *which has a non publically routable IP* and `R3` ?**

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180712025911915.png)
In this case you basically will map a Public IP Address to R1's address.
So R3 points to the publically NAT'ed IP of R1 and R1 points directly to R3.

> Routers have a special charesctersistic called **NAT Detection** , this is an inbuilt feature of IPSEC which always takes place . This is basically becuase in the intial negotiation the ipsec devices send their local ip to the remote ipsec endpoint. THe remote endpoint can then do the necessary accomodation as per NAT-T .

In this case on the ASA you have to allow IPSEC and ESP

```sh
access-list OUTSIDE permit udp host x.x.x.x host x.x.x.x eq 500
access-list OUTSIDE permit esp host x.x.x.x host x.x.x.x eq 4500
!
access-group OUTSIDE in interface outside
```

### Individual Interface Mode

The this mode , the ports are **not** in a port channel and are Individual interfaces with IP address configured to them via the Master ASA.

The Routers do the logic of Equal Cost Load Balancing to send the traffic IN or OUT side to the ASA as they peer with the ASA as `EIGRP`.

# Firepower and FTD

> Firepower is the IPS Only , FTD is Firewall Code + IPS .

You can add SSD to the ASA and install the FTD OS on it .

To configure IP Address on FMC
```sh
sudo su
configure-network ! Shell script
```

```sh
! Point the FTD towards FMC
configure manager add 192.168.1.66 cisco123
```

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180723073910775.png)

`Access Control Policy` : Is the default Firewall behaviour , Block All traffic , Allow all traffic etc .

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180723074246812.png)

After you make changes on FMC , the changes arent depolyed untill you manually push it from the FMC (Using the Deploy Button) .

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180723075229802.png)

> Notice the "Show Rule Conflict" ; It tells you if a rule conflicts with other and help you do the ordering of the rules.
![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180723080906140.png)


Things to Do :

1. CREATE Access Control Policy
2. Add Rule : INT TO OUT : Allow from Inside Zone to Outside Zone
3. Add Rule : In to Out : Block FB , Using the Applications Tab .
4. Drag Rule 2 above Rule 1
5. Enable R1 to telnet and ping into R3 .  (Outside to DMZ) . For PING you may need to create the port manually .
6. Configure Static Routing on the FTD .
    - Create a Loopback network on a connected Router
    - Point to the Loopback Network from the FTD , via the Interface on the FTD , poining to the nexthop.
    - Also create a static router , like Source 2.2.2.2 going to Router Next hop or 3.3.3.3
7. Create an OSPF Neighborship with an external Router .
    - Keep it simple on How would you run the OSPF on the router.
8. Create a RIP Routing like step 7 and do a re-distribution between the OSPF and RIP
9. Create NAT Scenario to do Object NAT . Both Static and Dynamic .
10. Do a Port Translation as Well , say SimpleHTTPServer 80 : 8080

11. Try doing Twice NAT


12. Do a Face Block by ACL for internal users .
13. Create an Intrusion POlicy and try sending an threat . FOR604 virus .
14. Stop people to be able to upload a document or PPT File .

15. Configure a Site to Site VPN between to FTD connected to the same FMC
      -  Create the VPN
      - Create the access list on eact ftd to define the interesting traffic

## Anti-Spoofing ACLs

To stop spoofed IP Address , you can use ACLs on an interface and define what IP you would like to block which are sourced from your network (but does not logically come from that interface)

uRPF Reverse Path Forwarding Check

Using uRPF instead of creating an ACL for every network you can use this technology to do it automatically for you .

It checks the source of a packet agains the routing table and if the return path of the packet is same as the source , it is allowed .


uRPF Configuration

```sh
ip verify unicast source reachable-via rx allow-default
! allow-default means check the default gateway of the source packet , and if: its pointing in the right direction let it go.
```

There could be case where the packet is coming in from one interface but is exiting out from another interface (typical in case of multiple ISP links to a router) . In this case uRPF migh block this genuine flow and an exception would have to be made . The same can be defined by the use of ACLs (ACL 150 in this example).

```ip verify unicast source reachable-via rx allow-default 150 ```

To log RPF packets , create a log ACL and add it to the RPF command (like the example above)

The above is an example of strict RPF check denoted by `rx` .
If you change the `rx` to `any` it means that as long as the reverse path is in the routing table its allowed. (Not confinign it to the interface it came in from)

```ip verify unicast source reachable-via any ```

## Switchport port security

Switch port security commands

The command below manually assigns an MAC Address

`switchport port-security mac XXXX.XXXX.XXXX `

The command below  assigns an sticky MAC Address , which means the first MAC is allowed and others are not.

`switchport port-security mac sticky `

The command below will limit the maximum amount of MAC addresses which can be learned on an interface.

`switchport port-security max 5 `

Once a switch is put in the error disable mode , you can set the recovery time like the following :

```sh
errdisable recovery cause psecure-violation
errdisable recovery interval 180 ! Time after which recovery can happen.
```

## DHCP Snooping

DHCP Snopping is to make sure that only a valid DHCP Server is used to respond to the DHCP request and any rogue DHCP Server cannot offer the DHCP OFFER.

```sh
ip dhcp snooping ! Turn the feature on
ip dhcp snooping vlan 10 ! Enable for the appropriate VLAN.
```

The above command will basically stop DHCP on the entire VLAN 10 untill you enable / trust the port to which the DHCP server is connected.

```sh
int gi0/3 ! Port to which the DHCP Server is connected.
 ip dhcp snooping trust
```

> In case of switch connected to the other switch on which the DHCP Server is connected , the **trunk port would be configured as the trusted** port.

As a result of DHCP Configuration , the switch maintains a DHCP Snooping table of assigned IP Addresses and ports.

## ARP Inspection

ARP Inspection is to save from ARP Poisining **(MITM)** type attacks.

ARP inspection basically uses the DB built by DHCP snooping to match the right MAC adresses on the switch port .

```sh
ip dhcp snooping ! Turn the feature on
ip dhcp snooping vlan 10 ! Enable for the appropriate VLAN.
ip arp inspection vlan 10
```

```sh
int gi0/3 ! Port to which the DHCP Server is connected.
 ip dhcp snooping trust
 ip arp inspection trust
```


## Source Gaurd

Source gaurd combines the capabilities of `port security` and `arp inspection`.

```sh
int gi0/3 ! Port to which the Sourcegaud is to be enabled.
 ip verify source
```

This will ensure the port is checked for MAC , IP , VLAN and Port against the DHCP Snooping DB.

## VLAN ACL

Allows you to control traffic withing the VLAN , going in and out of a VLAN.

```sh
1. Classify the traffic

access-list 100 permit icmp any any
access-list 100 permit udp eq .... whatever


2. Create the ACL

vlan access-map VMAP 10
 match ip address 100
 action drop
vlan access-map VMAP 20
 action forward

3. Apply the VLAN ACL to the appropriate VLAN

vlan filter VMAP vlan-list 10,20
```

# WSA (Web Security Agent)


Web Filtering and Caching (Adult,Gambling,News,Sports,Social Networks etc)
WSA has Proxy ports apart from managment labbeled as P1 / P2 .

There are two modes

1. Inline mode
2. Transparent Mode

In inline mode the browsers/end computes know about the WSA , in transparent mode the end devices are pointing to the default gateway which in turn talks to the WSA via WCCP .

To enable WCCP on WSA

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180803022116122.png)

**Configuring WCCP on ASA**

```sh
1. Configure the IP Address of the WSA in an ACL

access-list WSA_ACL permit ip host 192.168.1.10 any ! IP Address of the WSA

2. Configure the ACL that specifies what traffic needs to be redirected

access-list 101 permit tcp any any eq 80
access-list 101 permit tcp any any eq 8080

3. Setup a Tunnel between the redirectign device (in this Scenario a Switch) and the WCCP Server.

> The tag needs to match on the Switch and the WCCP Server

wccp 99 group-list WSA_ACL redirect-list REDIRECT ! It means that and traffic matching the REDIRECT ACL should be sent to the WSA (WSA_ACL)
with a service tag of 99

4. Apply the WCCP Redirection to the interface (of the device doing redirection)

wccp 99 redirect in interface inside

```

**Configuring WCCP on Router**


![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180805020822970.png)

> On a **switch** you need to configure `sdm prefer routing` and reload.

```sh

Enable WCCP

ip wccp ver 2

1. Configure the IP Address of the WSA in an ACL

access-list 101 permit ip host 10.10.10.10 any! IP Address of the WSA

2. Configure the ACL that specifies what traffic needs to be redirected

access-list 102 permit tcp any any eq 80
access-list 102 permit tcp any any eq 8080

3. Setup a Tunnel between the redirectign device  and the WCCP Server.

> The tag needs to match on the Switch and the WCCP Server

ip wccp 99 group-list 101 redirect-list 102 ! It means that and traffic matching the REDIRECT ACL should be sent to the WSA (WSA_ACL)
with a service tag of 99

4. Apply the WCCP Redirection to the interface (of the device doing redirection)

interface f0/1
 ip wccp 99 redirect in

```

show ip wccp 99 view

**Configuring the WSA Side**

1. Change the Mode to WCCP
![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180805012741862.png)


![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180805013132415.png)

Dont forget to commit chnages .

After commiting the changes  you will see the following happen on the router

```sh
Router#sh ip wccp 99 view
*Aug  5 05:32:45.617: %WCCP-5-SERVICEFOUND: Service 99 acquired on WCCP client 10.10.10.10
    WCCP Routers Informed of:
	192.168.1.106

    WCCP Clients Visible:
	10.10.10.10
```
**At this stage a session between the router and the WSA is established**

2. Now go to the Web proxy Settings and add any no 80 ports to the proxy settings.


![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180805013434129.png)

**Now you will set your policies**

Now to set and define your internet access policies you have to first define the end users in groups . This can be based on their IP Address or Group information received from AD (WSA intergrates with AD)

Go to `Identification Profiles`

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180805014149446.png)

Define / Create the EXEC and SALES policies

![](/assets/markdown-img-paste-20180805014554975.png)

Now create the `Access Policy`

# Cisco ASA with Anyconnect VPN using SSL or IKEv1/v2

Clientless VPNs are limited and convoluted to access WEB , FTP and CIFS.


# Cisco ISE

## Device Profiling

**Profilinig is performed by policy services node.**

In a typical open network any device can get an IP address and more often then not it is all access.

From a network admin perspective you would like to know whats connected to your network and also limit access based on device type.

There are various probes which can help which can help gather as much details as possible.

Profiling enables ISE to recognise the device and understand what it is. It enables ISE to know the type of client endpoint.

Profiling is made up to two components :

Probes: Probes Allows ISE to collect different device attributes.
Profiling Policies : ISE Allows to match these device attribute to further define which policies does it map to .


![](assets/markdown-img-paste-20181103212358192.png)

DHCP :  Setup via Helper Address / DHCP Relay

HTTP : Browser type , OS Type in the User Agent Attribute (When URL Redirect Happens)

RADIUS : Attributed coming in via Dot1.X

DNS : ISE to be able to reverse lookup and get hostname.

**AAA Switch configuration**

```sh

aaa authentication login default local
aaa authentication login NOAUTH none
aaa authentication  dot1x default group radius
aaa authorization network default group radius
aaa accounting update newinfo periodic 3
aaa accounting indentity default start-stop group radius
aaa acciunting system default start-stop group radius

device-sensor notify all-changes ! Allows switch to gather info and send it to ise.

logging host X.X.X.X transport udp port 20514 ! Allows Switch log messages to be sent to ISE
ip helper-address X.X.X.X on the VLAN of the devices pointing to the ISE Server.

Next Step to make WLC Managment IP in a specific VLAN and rest in other VLANs.

--

**Difference Between Flexconnect and Local**

In local mode, an AP creates two CAPWAP tunnels to the WLC.  One is for management, the other is data traffic.  This behavior is known as "centrally switched" because the data traffic is switched(bridged) from the ap to the controller where it is then routed by some routing device.



Flex Connect also known as HREAP by the old timers, allows data traffic to be switched locally and not go back to the controller.  It basically causes the AP to behave like an autonomous AP, but be managed by the WLC.  In this mode, the AP can still function even if it looses connection with the controller.

**Centrally Switched VLANs**

Make sure the VLANs are centrally switched when using a virtual WLC

*Mar  1 05:13:32.002: %GDOI-4-GM_RE_REGISTER: The IPSec SA created for group ABC may have expired/been cleared, or didn not go through. Re-register to KS.

```


#### Error Messages and Resolution

```sh
*Mar  1 00:42:09.431: %CRYPTO-4-IKMP_BAD_MESSAGE: IKE message from 192.1.20.2 failed its sanity check or is malformed
```
The above warrants a key mismatch .

```sh

```

This was caused due to the following commands missing from the DMVPN Clients


```sh

# Publishing your site

The great thing about hosting project documentation in a `git` repository is
the ability to deploy it automatically when new changes are pushed. MkDocs
makes this ridiculously simple.

## GitHub Pages

If you're already hosting your code on GitHub, [GitHub Pages][1] is certainly
the most convenient way to publish your project documentation. It's free of
charge and pretty easy to set up.

  [1]: https://pages.github.com/

### with GitHub Actions

Using [GitHub Actions][2] you can automate the deployment of your project
documentation. At the root of your repository, create a new GitHub Actions
workflow, e.g. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and copy and paste the following
contents:

=== "Material for MkDocs"

    ``` yaml
    name: ci
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - master
    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
            with:
              python-version: 3.x
          - run: pip install mkdocs-material
          - run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
    ```

=== "Insiders"

    ``` yaml
    name: ci
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - master
    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
            with:
              python-version: 3.x
          - run: pip install git+https://${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git
          - run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
    env:
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
    ```

Now, when a new commit is pushed to `master`, the static site is automatically
built and deployed. Commit and push the file to your repository to see the
workflow in action.

Your documentation should shortly appear at `<username>.github.io/<repository>`.

_Remember to set the_ `GH_TOKEN` _environment variable to the value of your
[personal access token][3] when using [Material for MkDocs Insiders][4], which
can be done using [secrets][5]._

  [4]: insiders.md
  [5]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets

### with MkDocs

If you prefer to deploy your project documentation manually, you can just invoke
the following command from the directory containing the `mkdocs.yml` file:

```
mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

## GitLab Pages

If you're hosting your code on GitLab, deploying to [GitLab Pages][6] can be
done by using the [GitLab CI][7] task runner. At the root of your repository,
create a task definition named `.gitlab-ci.yml` and copy and paste the
following contents:

=== "Material for MkDocs"

    ``` yaml
    image: python:latest
    deploy:
      stage: deploy
      only:
        - master
      script:
        - pip install mkdocs-material
        - mkdocs build --site-dir public
      artifacts:
        paths:
          - public
    ```

=== "Insiders"

    ``` yaml
    image: python:latest
    deploy:
      stage: deploy
      only:
        - master
      script:
        - pip install git+https://${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git
        - mkdocs build --site-dir public
      artifacts:
        paths:
          - public
    ```

Now, when a new commit is pushed to `master`, the static site is automatically
built and deployed. Commit and push the file to your repository to see the
workflow in action.

Your documentation should shortly appear at `<username>.gitlab.io/<repository>`.

_Remember to set the_ `GH_TOKEN` _environment variable to the value of your
[personal access token][3] when using [Material for MkDocs Insiders][4], which
can be done using [masked custom variables][8]._
